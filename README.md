Orebfuscator empowers server owners to protect their server from X-Ray Clients and Texture Packs, all while offering a high degree of configurability. This is achieved through modifying network packets without altering your game world, guaranteeing a secure and reliable experience for users. With Orebfuscator, you can tailor the settings to suit your server's needs, ensuring precise control over the visibility of specific blocks.
